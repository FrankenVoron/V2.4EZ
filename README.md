# V2.4EZ

V2.4EZ is a fork of the VORON2.4 and VORONTrident printers:

VORON2.4: https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-2

VORONTrident: https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident

# Goal: 
Provide a clean upgrade path from a stock V2.4 to an insulated V2.4 with a solid extrusion door, with minimal printed parts required and no core functional part changes. This means you can purchase a V2.4 printed functional parts kit and build this without any additional printed parts, then print the remaining cosmetic skirt pieces.

# Purchased part changes:

-Vertical extrusions change from 2020 to 4040 (HFSB5-4040-XXX-LCP-RCP)

-Horizontal extrusions on the bottom change from 2020 to 4020 (HFSB5-2040-XXX-TPW)

-Spare 2020 Horizontal extrusions from the bottom move to the top to retain panels

-EZ Front Door (4x 2020 extrusions, 2x HHPBSN5-SET hinges, 1x HFHDLB5-35 handle)

# Printed part changes:

-No core functional printed parts are changed except for power inlet (can use V2.4 inlet temporarily)

-Trident side skirts (stock) are used with same 250/300/350mm build size options

-EZ Front Skirts are used (40mm deep, with fixed mini12864 mount) to sit flush with door when closed

-V2.4EZ rear skirt is used (Trident + V2.4 skirt design mixture to clear Z drives)

-Trident style printed corner covers fit around existing V2.4 Z drives


# Other notes:

-Can reuse existing deck, top, side, and rear panels to start with

-Printer bottom electronics cover is new--extends 20mm extra in each direction

-EZ Front Door requires new polycarbonate piece (can purchase size to fit in channel of extrusions, or do Doom "double PC panel" solution)

-Optional, can insert reflectix in extrusion slots on sides and back, and below deck panel. Top Reflectix insulation TBD
